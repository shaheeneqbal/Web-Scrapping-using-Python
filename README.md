# Web-Scrapping-using-Python

This project provides a Python-based solution for web scraping, allowing us to extract data from websites. Web scraping is the process of extracting and parsing data from websites in an automated fashion using a computer program. It's a useful technique for creating datasets for research and learning. It utilizes the two libraries BeautifulSoup and Requests for parsing HTML and extracting information, making it easier to navigate and extract data from web pages. Also using the Pandas Library for Scrapped data into a DataFrame.
